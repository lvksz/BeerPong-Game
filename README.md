## Game Rules and Points System

In BeerPong-Game, players compete in beer pong matches and earn points based on their performance and the challenge of each match. Here’s a plain language description of how it works:

**Ranking:**
- Every player starts at the base rank called "Żelazo."
- As you win matches, you accumulate points and move up through the ranks: Żelazo, Brąz, Srebro, Złoto, Platyna, Diament, and finally Mistrz.
- Once you reach "Mistrz," you’ve hit the top and won’t advance further.

**Earning and Losing Points:**
- Each match gives the winner a base score of 20 points.
- When you win a match, you earn extra points based on several factors:
  - **Opponent’s Rank:** If you beat an opponent with a higher rank than yours, you get an extra 2 points for each rank level they have above you. For example, defeating someone two ranks higher earns you an additional 4 points.
  - **Remaining Cups:** You also earn extra points equal to the number of cups the winner has left at the end of the match.
  - **Additional Bonus:** Under certain conditions, such as playing away from home and having a short win streak, you receive a bonus of 3 extra points.
- The points you earn are added to your total, while the same amount of points is deducted from your opponent.

**Rank Progression:**
- When you accumulate a total of 150 points, you’re promoted to the next rank and 150 points are subtracted from your score.
- Conversely, if your points drop below zero, you may be demoted to a lower rank (though no player can fall below the starting rank of "Żelazo").

This system rewards taking on tougher opponents and performing well, ensuring that every match has a meaningful impact on your ranking.
