## Game Rules and Points System

In BeerPong-Game, players compete in beer pong matches and earn points based on their performance and the challenge of each match. Here’s a plain language description of how it works:

**Ranking:**
- Every player starts at the base rank called "Żelazo."
- As you win matches, you accumulate points and move up through the ranks: Żelazo, Brąz, Srebro, Złoto, Platyna, Diament, and finally Mistrz.
- Once you reach "Mistrz," you’ve hit the top and won’t advance further.

**Earning and Losing Points:**
- Each match gives the winner a base score of 20 points.
- Extra points are awarded based on:
  - The difference between the winner’s rank and the opponent’s rank. Beating a higher-ranked opponent earns you more points.
  - The number of remaining cups you have at the end of the match.
  - In some cases, an additional bonus is applied if you’re playing away from home and your winning streak is short.
- The winning player gets these extra points added to their total, while the losing player has the same amount deducted.

**Rank Progression:**
- When you build up 150 points, you get promoted to the next rank, and your points are reduced by 150 as you move up.
- If you lose points and drop below zero, you might be demoted to a lower rank. However, no one can go lower than the starting rank "Żelazo."

This points and ranking system ensures that each match has a meaningful impact on your overall standing, rewarding excellent performance and making comebacks exciting.
